"""
Filtered Model Formset Table views.md
    - re-useable integrations of FilterView, ModelFormsetView, and SingleTableMixin
Purpose:
    - sef of abstract class-based views.md that provide a declarative syntax to hide
      the integration details
Core Problem:
    - Filters, ModelFormsets, and Tables all need a queryset
    - in a F-MF-T view, they need to share the same queryset - getting the MRO right
      is essential!
    - Tables need special logic to render a formset, and need the formset available at
      construct any "extra" rows.
    - Formset data need to be the [paged] table_data.  Chicken meet Egg.
